<objective>
Enhance the placeholder 1D optimization algorithm with a proper First Fit Decreasing (FFD) implementation.

Purpose: The Phase 18 placeholder uses a basic greedy algorithm. FFD is a well-established bin packing heuristic that produces near-optimal results by sorting items descending before placement. This improves waste reduction for real woodworking scenarios.

Output: Enhanced `optimizeCuts1D()` function with verified FFD behavior and total linear feet summary.

  <name>Task 1: Enhance FFD Algorithm with Stock Sorting</name>
  <files>src/lib/server/cutOptimizer.ts</files>
  <action>
Enhance the `optimizeCuts1D()` function with a proper First Fit Decreasing algorithm:

1. **Verify cut sorting (already exists):** `expandedCuts.sort((a, b) => b.length - a.length)` - confirm this is present and correct

2. **Add stock sorting:** Sort `expandedStock` descending by length BEFORE the placement loop. This ensures longest stock pieces are tried first, maximizing cuts per piece:
   ```typescript
   expandedStock.sort((a, b) => b.length - a.length);
   ```

3. **Keep existing kerf handling:** The current kerf formulas are correct:
   - Placement check (lines 140-146): Uses `plan.cuts.length * kerf` for trailing kerf after each existing cut, then `requiredLength` adds kerf before new cut. This correctly accounts for N kerfs when adding the (N+1)th cut.
   - Waste calculation (line 197): Uses `(plan.cuts.length - 1) * kerf` which is the N-1 kerfs between N cuts. This is mathematically correct.

4. **Add total linear feet to summary:** Update the `OptimizationResult.summary` interface and calculation:
   - Add `totalLinearFeetUsed: number` - sum of all stock piece lengths actually used
   - Add `totalLinearFeetAvailable: number` - sum of all expanded stock lengths (what user has)

   Calculate after plans are built:
   ```typescript
   const totalLinearFeetUsed = plans.reduce((sum, plan) => sum + plan.stockLength, 0);
   const totalLinearFeetAvailable = expandedStock.reduce((sum, s) => sum + s.length, 0);
   ```

   Convert inches to feet for display: divide by 12.

5. **Keep existing validation and error handling** - the current max cut vs max stock check is correct.

Key principle: FFD = First Fit Decreasing. "Decreasing" means sorted descending. "First Fit" means take the first bin that fits (break out of loop on first match).

Run the dev server and test optimization with these scenarios:

1. **Basic FFD test:**
   - Cuts: 24", 18", 12", 6" (qty 1 each)
   - Stock: 48" (qty 2)
   - Expected: 2 stock pieces used, cuts sorted as 24, 18, 12, 6 before placement

2. **Multiple stock lengths:**
   - Cuts: 70", 40", 30" (qty 1 each)
   - Stock: 96" (qty 1), 72" (qty 1)
   - Expected: 96" gets 70", 72" gets 40"+30" (or similar efficient packing)

3. **Kerf handling:**
   - Cuts: 23.5" (qty 2)
   - Stock: 48" (qty 1)
   - Kerf: 0.125"
   - Expected: Both cuts fit (23.5 + 0.125 + 23.5 = 47.125" < 48")

Verify console shows no TypeScript errors.
  </verify>
  <done>
- `optimizeCuts1D()` sorts cuts descending by length (FFD "Decreasing")
- `optimizeCuts1D()` sorts stock descending by length (try longest first)
- Kerf calculation uses correct (N-1) formula for waste calculation
- Summary includes `totalLinearFeetUsed` and `totalLinearFeetAvailable` (in feet, not inches)
- Existing tests/scenarios continue to work
  </done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update Summary Interface and Display</name>
  <files>src/lib/server/cutOptimizer.ts</files>
  <action>
Update the OptimizationResult summary interface to include linear feet metrics:

1. **Extend summary type:**
   ```typescript
   summary: {
     totalCuts: number;
     totalStockUsed: number;
     totalWaste: number;
     wastePercentage: number;
     unplacedCuts: string[];
     // NEW for Phase 19:
     totalLinearFeetUsed: number;    // feet (not inches)
     totalLinearFeetAvailable: number; // feet (not inches)
   };
   ```

2. **Calculate in optimizeCuts1D:**
   After `totalStockMaterial` calculation, add:
   ```typescript
   // Linear feet summary (convert from inches)
   const totalLinearFeetUsed = totalStockMaterial / 12;
   const totalLinearFeetAvailable = expandedStock.reduce((sum, s) => sum + s.length, 0) / 12;
   ```

3. **Update return statement** to include the new fields.

4. **Update optimizeCuts2D** to return 0 for linear feet fields (they don't apply to sheet mode):
   ```typescript
   totalLinearFeetUsed: 0,
   totalLinearFeetAvailable: 0,
   ```

5. **Update error returns** in both functions to include the new fields with value 0.

Note: The display of these values in the UI happens in Plan 02 (OptimizationResults.svelte enhancement).
  </action>
  <verify>
1. TypeScript compilation succeeds: `npm run check`
2. Test optimization returns new fields:
   - Cuts: 24" (qty 4)
   - Stock: 96" (qty 2)
   - Expected: `totalLinearFeetUsed: 8` (96" = 8'), `totalLinearFeetAvailable: 16` (192" = 16')

3. Both `optimizeCuts1D` and `optimizeCuts2D` return objects with matching structure (no type errors).
  </verify>
  <done>
- OptimizationResult.summary interface has `totalLinearFeetUsed` and `totalLinearFeetAvailable`
- Values are in feet (divided by 12), not inches
- Both 1D and 2D functions return consistent structure
- `npm run check` passes with no type errors

  <name>Task 3: Verify Phase 18 Linear Input Forms (Smoke Test)</name>
  <files>N/A (verification only)</files>
  <action>
Verify that Phase 18's implementation of CUT-11, CUT-12, CUT-13 works correctly for linear mode. This ensures the input foundation is solid before enhancing the algorithm.

Run the following smoke tests on the existing /cutlist page:

1. **CUT-11 - Linear mode accepts cut lengths:**
   - Select Linear mode
   - Add a cut with length 24", quantity 2
   - Verify: Cut appears in the list with correct values
   - Verify: Only length field is shown (no width field in linear mode)

2. **CUT-12 - Linear mode accepts stock lengths:**
   - Add stock with length 96", quantity 1
   - Verify: Stock appears in the list with correct values
   - Verify: Only length field is shown (no width field in linear mode)

3. **CUT-13 - Linear mode supports multiple stock length options:**
   - Add a second stock with length 72", quantity 2
   - Verify: Both stock options appear in the list
   - Run optimization
   - Verify: Algorithm can use both stock lengths in results

Document any issues found. If Phase 18 input forms work correctly, this confirms the foundation is solid for the algorithm enhancement.
