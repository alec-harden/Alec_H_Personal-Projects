# Plan 26-01: Wizard Consumables Toggle

**Phase:** 26 - AI & Wizard Updates
**Wave:** 1
**Requirements:** WIZ-01, WIZ-03

## Objective

Add "Include Consumable Items" toggle to the BOM wizard so users can control whether consumables appear in AI-generated BOMs.

## Files Modified

- `src/lib/types/bom.ts` — Added `includeConsumables?: boolean` to ProjectDetails
- `src/lib/components/bom/ProjectTypeStep.svelte` — Added toggle UI above template grid
- `src/lib/components/bom/BOMWizard.svelte` — Wired state through wizard flow

## Implementation Summary

### Task 1: Type Update (WIZ-03)
Added `includeConsumables?: boolean` field to `ProjectDetails` interface with JSDoc comment.

### Task 2: Toggle UI (WIZ-01)
Added checkbox toggle to ProjectTypeStep with:
- Label: "Include Consumable Items"
- Description: "Sandpaper, glue, tape, and other shop supplies"
- Default: checked (true)
- Styled to match artisan aesthetic

### Task 3: State Wiring
- Added `includeConsumables` state to BOMWizard
- Updated `handleTemplateSelect` to accept and store consumables value
- Updated `handleMaterialsSubmit` to include in final ProjectDetails
- Updated ProjectTypeStep binding to pass state

## Verification

- [x] Toggle visible in Step 1 of wizard
- [x] Toggle state persists through wizard completion
- [x] ProjectDetails includes `includeConsumables` when passed to API
