| Email functions (send, generate, verify) | 10 | 0 | OK |
| BOM utilities (board feet, dimensions) | 4 | 0 | OK |
| Cut optimizer (algorithms, types) | 4 | 0 | OK |
| **Total** | **32** | **0** | **OK** |

### API Route Coverage

| Route | Method | Called By | Status |
|-------|--------|-----------|--------|
| `/api/cutlist/optimize` | POST | cutlist/+page.svelte | OK |
| `/api/cutlist/save` | POST | cutlist/+page.svelte | OK |
| `/api/cutlist/[id]/cuts/[cutId]` | PATCH | ShopChecklist, ManualPlacement | OK |
| `/api/bom/[id]` | DELETE | projects/[id]/bom/[bomId] | OK |
| `/api/bom/save` | POST | bom/new | OK |

### E2E Flows Verified

| # | Flow | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | User signup -> email verification -> profile shows verified badge | COMPLETE |
| 2 | Forgot password -> email -> reset password -> login with new password | COMPLETE |
| 3 | Admin creates user -> user can login | COMPLETE |
| 4 | Create BOM with lumber -> import to cut list -> optimize -> save -> view checklist | COMPLETE |
| 5 | Cut optimizer linear mode -> save -> view -> mark cuts complete | COMPLETE |
| 6 | Cut optimizer sheet mode -> save -> manual placement tab | COMPLETE |

## Tech Debt

None. All previously identified tech debt items were resolved in Phase 22:

- ✓ Sidebar Cut List navigation now points to `/cutlists` (listing page)
- ✓ UserMenu includes "Manage Users" link for admins
- ✓ Phase 18 requirements verified via Phase 19 verification
- ✓ Phase 21 work verified via integration testing

## Conclusion

**v3.0 Milestone is COMPLETE** with all 59 requirements satisfied across 10 phases:

- **RBAC & Security:** Role-based access control with data isolation
- **User Management:** Admin can create, view, disable, and reset users
- **Email Flows:** Password reset and email verification working
- **BOM Refinements:** Lumber dimensions, board feet, eye icon toggle
- **Cut List Optimizer - Core:** Dashboard, mode selector, input forms, save
- **Cut List Optimizer - Linear:** FFD algorithm, linear feet, SVG diagrams
- **Cut List Optimizer - Sheet:** Guillotine algorithm, grain direction, 2D diagrams
- **BOM Integration:** Import lumber from BOMs to cut list optimizer
- **Shop Checklist:** Completion tracking with persistence
- **UI Refinements:** User names, sidebar restructure, results page, cut list listing

All cross-phase integration verified. All E2E flows functional. No gaps or tech debt remaining.

**Next step:** `/gsd:complete-milestone v3.0`
