## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| OAuth login (Google/GitHub) | Email/password sufficient for single-user app |
| Real-time collaboration | Single user focus |
| Mobile app | Web-first, responsive design sufficient |
| Pricing/cost estimation | May add in future, not v2.0 |
| Inventory tracking | Separate tool if needed |
| Cut list optimization | Separate tool if needed |
| 3D visualization | Complexity not justified |
| Session caching (Redis) | Over-optimization for single-user |
| Multi-tenancy | v3.0+ scope |
