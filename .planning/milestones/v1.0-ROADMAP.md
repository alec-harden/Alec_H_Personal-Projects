# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-23
**Phases:** 1-7
**Total Plans:** 15

## Overview

Build a modular web application for woodworking tools, starting with an AI-powered Bill of Materials generator. The journey goes from project scaffolding through AI integration, guided BOM workflow, editing capabilities, export, and final polish — delivering a usable personal tool for woodworking project planning.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation

**Goal**: Project scaffolding with SvelteKit, database, and basic routing
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: SvelteKit scaffolding with Tailwind CSS v4 and Drizzle ORM
- [x] 01-02: Dashboard UI with Header and ToolCard components

**Completed:** 2026-01-20

### Phase 2: AI Integration

**Goal**: Working AI conversation infrastructure with Vercel AI SDK
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01: Vercel AI SDK with provider factory pattern
- [x] 02-02: Chat UI components and streaming endpoint

**Completed:** 2026-01-20

### Phase 3: BOM Core Flow

**Goal**: User can complete guided prompt workflow and receive AI-generated BOM
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01: BOM TypeScript types and 5 woodworking project templates
- [x] 03-02: BOM generation API endpoint with structured Zod output
- [x] 03-03: Guided prompt wizard UI with 4-step flow
- [x] 03-04: BOM display components and dashboard integration

**Completed:** 2026-01-20

### Phase 4: BOM Editing

**Goal**: User can edit and customize generated BOM
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01: Inline quantity editing with click-to-edit pattern
- [x] 04-02: Visibility toggle for hiding items
- [x] 04-03: Add custom materials with AddItemForm component

**Completed:** 2026-01-21

### Phase 5: Export

**Goal**: User can export completed BOM to CSV
**Depends on**: Phase 4
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 05-01: RFC 4180 CSV export with category sorting

**Completed:** 2026-01-21

### Phase 6: Polish & Integration

**Goal**: End-to-end flow works smoothly, ready for personal use
**Depends on**: Phase 5
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 06-01: Error handling with classification and retry
- [x] 06-02: Responsive layout fixes for mobile/tablet

**Completed:** 2026-01-22

### Phase 7: Tech Debt Cleanup

**Goal**: Remove orphaned chat interface files from Phase 2->3 architecture pivot
**Depends on**: Phase 6
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 07-01: Delete orphaned chat files and remove @ai-sdk/svelte dependency

**Completed:** 2026-01-23

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- SvelteKit + Tailwind v4 + Drizzle ORM tech stack
- Provider factory pattern for AI (Anthropic/OpenAI via env)
- Guided wizard over free-form chat (Phase 3 pivot)
- Category-based material grouping (lumber, hardware, finishes, consumables)
- Toggle visibility vs delete (non-destructive editing)
- Click-to-edit inline editing pattern
- RFC 4180 CSV escaping for export

**Issues Resolved:**

- Tailwind v4 initialization (CSS-first approach with @tailwindcss/vite)
- AI SDK API key handling (createAnthropic/createOpenAI with explicit apiKey)
- Svelte 5 state_referenced_locally warnings (acceptable pattern for wizard)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- None — Phase 7 cleaned up orphaned chat interface from Phase 2→3 pivot
